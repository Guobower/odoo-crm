    'summary': "Send mail when a new lead is created",
    'description': """
When a new crm-lead is created from website_contact or mail to info@your_domain.com
a reminder is sent to administers with a copy of the mail or information from
the form.

To make this module work:

1) change the email-template (email_to,reply_to) so they reflect your domain and 
list of users that should have a notification
2) check the mail configuration so users have mail forwarding with a copy activated for
the mail-address to your catchall-address configured in Odoo

Todo:
* not send mail when leads are imported from csv-file or manually added (business opportunity)
* do not trigger this if there are no email_from
* the list of email_to could be fetched from group_sale_salesman or other group.
